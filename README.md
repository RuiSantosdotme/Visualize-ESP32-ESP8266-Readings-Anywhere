# Visualize Your Sensor Readings from Anywhere in the World (ESP32/ESP8266 + MySQL + PHP)

In this project you'll create a web page that displays sensor readings in a plot that you can access from anywhere in the world. In summary, youâ€™ll build an ESP32 or ESP8266 client that makes a request to a PHP script to publish sensor readings in a MySQL database.
